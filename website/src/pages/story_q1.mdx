1. What distribution does the difference between human and LLM distances follow?

### Are there any patterns we can observe in the difference between the semantic distances computed from human paths and the ones from LLM paths?

- This question aims to understand if whether we obtain identical semantic distances or not.
- And if not, try to see if we can find patterns:
    - Which ones are longer? LLM-based or human-based? By how much? What is the distribution?
    - Do the articles that have distances that differ the most belong to specific categories?

We wanted to see whether the games played by the LLMs would lead to different semantic distance measures. We computed the semantic distances between pairs of articles using both human game paths ad LLM game paths (without memory), using the same method as in the Wikispeedia paper. Then for all the pairs for which we had both an LLM distance and a human distance (TODO, which proportion), we plotted the difference between the two distances. We expected to have some differences, as the LLM played the game without memory, contrary to humans, potentially leading to different strategies, different concept associations and thus different semantic distances inferred.

In general, the semantic distances computed from LLM paths (without memory) are longer: 0.40 on average and 0.35 in median for LLM, vs 0.38 on average and 0.32 in median for humans. (TODO is this difference statistically meaningful?)

We found out that most article pairs had similar distances from humans and the LLM, with a mean and median distance difference of -0.02 and -0.03, respectively, and an big peak in our histogram at 0, meaning more than 1200 pairs have the same semantic distance for both humans and LLM. So, on average, the difference is only a small deviation from the average semantic distance, which is around 0.4 (both for LLM and humans). However, this small average difference hides the fact that there is actually quite some variance. Most distances distance differences are close to zero, but given that most distances are small, the differences are still significant in most cases. For example, 50% of the articles pairs that had both a human and an LLM semantic distance had an absolute difference in semantic distance of less than 0.12, but 0.12 represents more than 25% of the average distance. And this still leaves us with 50% of the pairs that have an even bigger distance difference between humans and LLM.0

The plot of differences looks somewhat like a Gaussian distribution centered around 0, with very small number of article pairs having very large distance differences (more than 0.5). However, the disproportionate peak at 0 breaks the normality of the data, and both the Anderson-Darling test, the D’Agostino’s K^2 test and a QQ plot show that the distances do not formally follow a normal distribution.

The conclusions we can draw from this are that while on average the behavior of the LLM seems to encode similar notions of semantic distances between concepts as humans, there is still some variance that make the distances dissimilar in non-negligible ways in a lot of cases. This was to be expected given the protocol the LLM follows, playing without remembering the past steps of its path as it moves through the graph, leading to potentially less strategic and planned decisions involving conceptual relationships, and a bit more random wandering, amplified by the randomness inherent to the LLM.

Regarding the distances obtained using the LLM with memory, we consider that they are not comparable because the paths of the LLM with memory do not exhibit the same pattern of getting away to a hub and then homing in on the goal, thus not allowing us to filter out the potentially irrelevant distances by using the point of minimum information gain. Hence, we did not perform the same analysis of semantic distance difference between human and memory-based LLM semantic distances.

Do the article pairs that have the biggest difference in their human vs LLM semantic distances belong to a specific category of follow a specific pattern? We looked at the 10% of article pairs that had the biggest difference, and found articles of all categories and all types of pairs. We were not able to identify a predominant pattern in these pairs of articles.

(TODO: move to another part, it does not belong to Q1)

Does the path length correlate with the semantic distance between the starting and goal article of the path? -> Yes, a little bit. So what? (Thomas)
