### **Project Proposal and Initial Analyses Checklist**

#### **Project Planning**
- [X] **Select Project**: Agree with team members on a project topic using the provided datasets and/or any additional data you plan to bring.
- [X] **Feasibility Check**: Verify that the proposed project is feasible given the datasets you plan to use. Perform initial data exploration to confirm project viability.

#### **Data Familiarization and Preprocessing**
- [X] **Data Loading**: Successfully load all relevant datasets for the project.
- [x] **Data Exploration**:
  - [x] Check data formats, data types, and distributions.
  - [x] Identify missing values or inconsistencies.
  - [x] Analyze data size and ensure you can handle it.
  - [x] Compute descriptive statistics for key variables (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.).
  - [x] Explore correlations, patterns, and relationships within the data.
- [x] **Data Preprocessing**:
  - [x] Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, correcting errors, etc.).
  - [x] Consider data filtering, enrichment, and transformations needed for analysis.
  - [x] Document all preprocessing steps in a Jupyter notebook.

#### **Project Goals and Analysis Plan**
- [X] **Research Questions**: Clearly outline the research questions to address.
- [ ] **Methods Outline**:
  - [X] Specify the methods and techniques you plan to use, including essential mathematical details.
  - [ ] Include alternative approaches considered and explain why they were dropped.
  - [x] Ensure your proposed plan for analysis and data handling is reasonable and well-documented.
  - [X] Create a timeline of major project milestones.

#### **Code and Documentation Quality**
- [X] **Code Organization**:
  - [X] Use the recommended GitHub template for your repository.
  - [X] Keep a clean and consistent structure for your project (folders for data, notebooks, scripts, etc.).
  - [X] Store the main analysis logic in scripts/modules separate from the notebook.
- [x] **Code Quality**:
  - [x] Ensure the code is clear, efficient, and well-documented.
  - [x] Include comments and explanations for complex or critical code sections.
  - [x] Follow best practices for coding (naming conventions, modularity, etc.).
- [X] **Version Control**: Use GitHub for version control with clear and regular commits.

#### **Deliverables Preparation**
- [ ] **README.md**:
  - [X] **Title**: Choose a concise and relevant project title.
  - [X] **Abstract**: Write a 150-word description of the projectâ€™s idea and goals.
  - [X] **Research Questions**: List the research questions.
  - [X] **Proposed Additional Datasets**: Provide details on additional datasets (if any), including data format, size, and how they will be managed/enriched.
  - [X] **Methods**: Briefly describe the analytical methods you plan to use.
  - [X] **Proposed Timeline**: Outline key project milestones and timeline.
  - [ ] **Organization**: Define internal team roles and responsibilities.
  - [x] **Questions for TAs (Optional)**: List any questions for teaching assistants.
- [x] **Jupyter Notebook**:
  - [X] Include all initial analyses, data exploration, preprocessing steps, and findings.
  - [x] Ensure the notebook is well-formatted with clear section headings and explanations.
  - [x] Visualize key insights from the data (charts, graphs, etc.).

#### **GitHub Repository Requirements**
- [X] **Repository Setup**:
  - [X] Create a public GitHub repository under the [epfl-ada GitHub organization](https://github.com/epfl-ada).
  - [X] Follow the repository naming convention: `ada-2023-project-`.
- [x] **Data Handling Pipeline**:
  - [x] Implement and document a complete data preprocessing pipeline.
  - [X] Include any additional scripts or modules needed for the analysis.
- [ ] **Notebook Submission**:
  - [X] Ensure that the primary Jupyter notebook is present and contains all initial analyses and findings.
  - [ ] Validate that the notebook is functioning correctly (no broken links/cells).

#### **Review and Feedback**
- [ ] **Internal Review**: Conduct a team review of the project plan, README.md, and code for clarity and completeness.
- [ ] **TA Consultation (Optional)**: Schedule office hours with TAs for feedback on your project proposal.
- [ ] **Final Adjustments**: Incorporate any feedback or adjustments before the final submission.
