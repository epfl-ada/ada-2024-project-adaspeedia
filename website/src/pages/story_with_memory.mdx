As a further step, we run our LLM with memory on this specific subset of unfinished paths, along with a sample of standard paths, to compare the performance of the memoryless LLM against the one with memory. In total, 13,411 paths are processed by our system.
As stated before, we begin by look at the lengths of the completed paths.

The median for the paths created by the LLM with memory is of 6 steps with a maximum of 57. Clearly, LLMs with memory tend to complete paths slower than without, showing that the machine is feeling around the articles and have difficulties finding a good suit. As for human, the llm with memory make outliers paths, a good way to have a better understanding is to take both datasets up to the 99 percentile. 
Let's look at this plot that compare the llm with memory with humans paths.

Over here, we can see more clearly how much both distributions are different. The llm with memory paths are spreading more towards the right, i.e. they are more lengthier in general.
As a first indicator, this shows that our machine with memory is not able to get faster than humans.

Even if the machine with memory is slower we can clearly see that it improves the success rate. We made the machine play on the paths unfinished by the llm without memory and we saw that it has a success rate of 56,3%.
