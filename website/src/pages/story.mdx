In a world where humanity must rebuild from the ashes, games may seem like a trivial pursuit. Yet, in the aftermath of the apocalypse, our mission at the **Applied Digital Anthropology (ADA)** department of the New Age government is anything but trivial. Tasked with restoring the essence of human civilization, we’ve turned to an unexpected cornerstone of human experience: games.

Our team is exploring how machines can simulate human cognition and strategies to help shape the future of this planet. Why games? Because they encapsulate problem-solving, strategic thinking, and creativity — traits essential for humanity’s survival and progress. To this end, we’ve embarked on a case study of [**Wikispeedia**](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/), a game that challenges players to navigate Wikipedia’s web of articles from one topic to another using only hyperlinks. Simple, yet deeply revealing of how humans connect concepts, prioritize paths, and think under constraints.

## Meet the Team
- **Dr. A. I.** - Our lead researcher, a brilliant mind in the field of artificial intelligence and human cognition.
- **Dr. E. M.** - Our resident expert in game theory and human psychology.
- **Dr. L. O.** - Our data scientist, who wrangles the vast amounts of data we collect from Wikispeedia.
- **Dr. R. O.** - Our game designer, who crafts the challenges that players face in Wikispeedia.
- **Dr. S. T.** - Our anthropologist, who studies the social dynamics of Wikispeedia players.

Together, we form **ADAspeedia**, a team united in exploring how machines can emulate and evolve human behavior. To discover the team members' individual stories, click [here](/team).

# A Human Blueprint
To recreate human-like behavior, we first need to understand how humans played Wikispeedia. What strategies did they use? Did they wander aimlessly or systematically? How did they balance the exploration of diverse topics with the focused goal of reaching their destination? These questions guided our initial analysis of the human dataset, revealing the intricacies of the paths taken, the cognitive shortcuts employed, and the common hurdles encountered.

For this, we have data extracted from the Previous Age. A team of researchers from EPFL has collected thousands of paths taken by humans, [unified in a single dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikispeedia.html).  
We've analyzed it to keep only the essentials :
- **Paths** - The sequence of articles visited by players (id & title of the articles separated by a comma).
