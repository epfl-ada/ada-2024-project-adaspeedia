Do you want to see more ? From the begging we saw how gpt4 play to Wikispeedia. How about other llm ?

Did you here about MistralAi. It is an European leader in artificial intelligence. We choose this llm and make it play the game. Let's see how it does.

Using the Z-score, for a 95% confidence interval, the minimum number of rows needed to get a statistical significant result is 385. We therefore take randomly 565 rows from the dataset. 

Let's compare openai and mistralai!

We can see that for both llm the success rate is similar. However, openai tends to loop more and mistralai tends to give more wrong answers. This can show differents digital minds. From that we can speculate that Mistral take a bigger temperature and therefore less predictable.

For the finished paths, we compared the number of steps taken and we can see that Mistral takes generally less step to get to the target article.
